Adversaries may enumerate files and directories or may search in specific locations of a host or network share for certain information within a file system.
Adversaries may use the information from File and Directory Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.
Many command shell utilities can be used to obtain this information.
Examples include <code>dir</code>, <code>tree</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>find</code>, and <code>locate</code>.
Custom tools may also be used to gather file and directory information and interact with the Native API.
Adversaries may also leverage a Network Device CLI on network devices to gather file and directory information .
