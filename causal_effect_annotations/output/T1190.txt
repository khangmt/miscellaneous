Adversaries may attempt to take advantage of a weakness in an Internet-facing computer or program using software, data, or commands in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior.
The weakness in the system can be a bug, a glitch, or a design vulnerability.
These applications are often websites, but can include databases , standard services , network device administration and management protocols , and any other applications with Internet accessible open sockets, such as web servers and related services.
Depending on the flaw being exploited this may include Exploitation for Defense Evasion.
If an application is hosted on cloud-based infrastructure and/or is containerized, then exploiting it may lead to compromise of the underlying instance or container.
This can allow an adversary a path to access the cloud or container APIs, exploit container host access via Escape to Host, or take advantage of weak identity and access management policies.
For websites and databases, the OWASP top 10 and CWE top 25 highlight the most common web-based vulnerabilities.
