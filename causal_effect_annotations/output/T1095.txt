Adversaries may use a non-application layer protocol for communication between host and C2 server or among infected hosts within a network.
The list of possible protocols is extensive.
Specific examples include use of network layer protocols, such as the Internet Control Message Protocol , transport layer protocols, such as the User Datagram Protocol , session layer protocols, such as Socket Secure , as well as redirected/tunneled protocols, such as Serial over LAN .
ICMP communication between hosts is one example.
Because ICMP is part of the Internet Protocol Suite, it is required to be implemented by all IP-compatible hosts.
However, it is not as commonly monitored as other Internet Protocols such as TCP or UDP and may be used by adversaries to hide communications.
