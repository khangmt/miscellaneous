Adversaries may abuse the ROM Monitor  by loading an unauthorized firmware with adversary code to provide persistent access and manipulate device behavior that is difficult to detect.
ROMMON is a Cisco network device firmware that functions as a boot loader, boot image, or boot helper to initialize hardware and software when the platform is powered on or reset.
Similar to TFTP Boot, an adversary may upgrade the ROMMON image locally or remotely  with adversary code and restart the device in order to overwrite the existing ROMMON image.
This provides adversaries with the means to update the ROMMON to gain persistence on a system in a way that may be difficult to detect.
