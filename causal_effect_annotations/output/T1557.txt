Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle  technique to support follow-on behaviors such as Network Sniffing or Transmitted Data Manipulation.
By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic , adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions.
For example, adversaries may manipulate victim DNS settings to enable other malicious activities such as preventing/redirecting users from accessing legitimate sites and/or pushing additional malware.
Adversaries may also manipulate DNS and leverage their position in order to intercept user credentials and session cookies.
Downgrade Attacks can also be used to establish an AiTM position, such as by negotiating a less secure, deprecated, or weaker version of communication protocol  or encryption algorithm.
Adversaries may also leverage the AiTM position to attempt to monitor and/or modify traffic, such as in Transmitted Data Manipulation.
Adversaries can setup a position similar to AiTM to prevent traffic from flowing to the appropriate destination, potentially to Impair Defenses and/or in support of a Network Denial of Service.
