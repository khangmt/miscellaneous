Adversaries may leverage traffic mirroring in order to automate data exfiltration over compromised network infrastructure.
Traffic mirroring is a native feature for some network devices and used for network analysis and may be configured to duplicate traffic and forward to one or more destinations for analysis by a network analyzer or other monitoring device.
Adversaries may abuse traffic mirroring to mirror or redirect network traffic through other network infrastructure they control.
Malicious modifications to network devices to enable traffic redirection may be possible through ROMMONkit or Patch System Image.
Adversaries may use traffic duplication in conjunction with Network Sniffing, Input Capture, or Adversary-in-the-Middle depending on the goals and objectives of the adversary.
